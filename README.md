Goal of the game is to kill the boss on each level. You can identify boss by finding special monster which is always one of a kind on each board. 
Once it's killed you will be able to move to next board (level).

Controls:

* arrows (up, down, left, right).

To attack enemy you need to move to its location.

During the game you can collect: 
* Swords - will help you attacking enemies
* Health potions - will give you additional health
* Diamonds - won't give you anything but you can compare with friends who gathered more ;)

Technicalities: 
* you need to have pillow and Tk installed in order to run the game
* you run the game through python Game.py or through any IDE like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm (through the Game.py)
* Fog of war was initially implemented on Linux but then it didn't work on Windows so currently disabled (though method is still there)
* Boards are editable via excel (stored in csv files)

Background: 
* game was created as python course final assignment - I think overall around 8 hours were spent including some new features done for fun after the course has finished ;)
* still - game is very basic and of course would be great to expand it to become something bigger... ;)
* Icons are made by Freepik (https://www.freepik.com) from https://www.flaticon.com/

It's loosely based on the snake tkinter game I found on the internet which I cannot now even locate to mention.
Feel free to use it and expand if you'd like.
